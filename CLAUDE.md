# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Farmasi is a complete personal loan management application for a lending company. It manages clients, loans, payments, interest rates, guarantees, and contracts. The system helps track loan disbursements, payment schedules, and guarantees for 6-week loan cycles.

**Current Status:** âœ… FULLY IMPLEMENTED - All core features are complete and functional.

## Development Commands

- **Development server**: `npm run dev` (uses Turbopack)
- **Build**: `npm run build` (uses Turbopack)
- **Production server**: `npm start`
- **Linting**: `npm run lint` (uses Biome)
- **Formatting**: `npm run format` (uses Biome with --write)
- **Database**: `npm run db:generate`, `npm run db:push`, `npm run db:migrate`, `npm run db:studio`, `npm run db:seed`

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router
- **React**: v19.1.0
- **TypeScript**: v5 with strict mode enabled
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with Shadcn UI components (New York style)
- **Code Quality**: Biome (replaces ESLint + Prettier)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma (planned)
- **Authentication**: Auth.js with credentials provider (planned)
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI with Lucide React icons
- **Email Service**: Brevo for email sending (planned)
- **Themes**: next-themes for dark/light mode support (planned)

## Project Structure

- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions (includes Tailwind merge utility)
- `@/components` - Reusable UI components (alias configured)
- `@/components/ui` - Shadcn UI components (alias configured)
- `@/lib` - Libraries and utilities (alias configured)
- `@/hooks` - Custom React hooks (alias configured)

## Architecture Guidelines

- **No Server Actions**: Use API routes instead of Next.js server actions
- **Component Strategy**: Use React Server Components for data fetching with direct Prisma queries where possible; use Client Components only for interactivity
- **File Organization**: Follow Next.js App Router conventions with TypeScript
- **Import Aliases**: Use `@/*` for src imports (configured in tsconfig.json)

## Business Domain
